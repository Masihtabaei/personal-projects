# List of Projects

Here you can find a list of some projects that I made a contribution to in the past.

## VR (and Computer Vision)-Projects

- "Bakery"-project @[Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/)
    - This project was carried out in 2023 by a research associate of [Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/) and me
        to simulate stress situations in the bakery dor trainees.
        You can find [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20231209172926/https://www.hwk-oberfranken.de/artikel/vr-backshop-bereichert-kuenftig-ausbildung-fuer-den-baeckereifachverkauf-72,0,3161.html) more information (in German language) about this project.  
        We used following technologies in this projects:

        - ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)
        - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenXR--Plugin_for_Unity-red?style=for-the-badge)
        - ![Visual Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio-5C2D91.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio&logoColor=white)

- "Voll-KI"-project @[Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/)
    - I made a brief contribution to this project in the summer of 2023, 
        where a research associate of [Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/) and I 
        developed a VR-room to teach computer science students the basics of machine learning and CNN.
        - ![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/unity-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity&logoColor=white)
        - ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)
        - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenXR--Plugin_for_Unity-red?style=for-the-badge)
        - ![Visual Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio-5C2D91.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio&logoColor=white)

- "Drawings Come Alive"-project @[Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/)
    - This project was carried out in the summer semester 2023 as part of the module "Study Project: Practical Computer Science" at [Coburg University of
        Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-coburg.de/) by 4 students of the Computer Science program under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Grubert](https://www.hs-coburg.de/ueber-uns/fakultaeten/elektrotechnik-und-informatik/personen/prof-dr-jens-grubert.html) both at home and in the [Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/). This project has its own [website](https://masihtabaei.gitbook.io/drawings-come-alive/) where you can find more information
        about the goal of the project and the technologies used.

- "Mixedreality for Mobile Work"-Research Project @[Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/)
    - I took part as a student assistant for data analysis in this project to evaluate studies (by annoating the videos).
        The outcome of this project was a publication. [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14920v2) you can find more information about it.
- "Corneal Imaging"- Research Project @[Mixedreailtylab](https://www.mixedrealitylab.de/)
    - I made a small contribution to this project by analysing the studies.

## Embedded Systems-Project

- Co-Operative Scheduler for Embedded Systems
    - This project was caried out as part of the course "Embedded Operating Systems" at [Coburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-coburg.de/).
        You can find more information about the project (e. g. images or videos) and the technologies used in this project
        in [this repository](https://github.com/Masihtabaei/embedded-os-with-cooperative-multitasking).
- Keil µVision Dark Theme (Persian Nights)
    - After a year of suffering under Keil µVision's light theme and hearing a thousand complaints from other students about Keil µVision not having a dark theme, I created one myself. In [this repository](https://github.com/Masihtabaei/keil-dark-theme-persian-nights) you will find some information
    (e. g. preview or usage) about this project.
- Cobit - A Minimal Embedded C Unit Test Framework
    - This framework was implemented over the night in summer of 2023 for testing my embedded programs written in C for Nucleo-Board (with an Arm Cortex M4 based processor / STM32G474). In [this repository](https://github.com/Masihtabaei/cobit-minimal-embedded-c-unit-test-framework) you will find more information about this project.
- Cobin - A Minimal Interpreter Written in C
    - This project was a part of the course "Applied Embedded Systems" at [Coburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-coburg.de/) where
        I used this interpreter as a command-based application (which could serve as a calculator) for a Nucleo-Board.
        In [this repository](https://github.com/Masihtabaei/cobin-minimal-interpreter-in-c) you will find more information about
        this project.
